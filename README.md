# Decathlon-Data-Analysis
An analysis of data publicly available on Power of 10.

See https://gormansam.github.io/Decathlon-Data-Analysis/ for the markdown file where I have code and analysis of the data from 2022.

I also have also developed a shiny app for users to plot their own performances on power of 10.
A live version of my shiny app for plotting performances can be found at [This Link](https://samgorman.shinyapps.io/ukathleticstools/), however I would strongly recommend downloading the file and running it yourself, as the website runs slowly. (See AthleticsTools.R above)

I have also included a little decathlon points calculator project which I wrote to learn some html basics. (See DecathlonTools.html above)
